      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>The body holds all children elements, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
        <li>Child elements inside body tag:<br>
          The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.<br>
         The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
        <li> Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won't see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
      </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>We assigned the CSS rule based on the element name. However, there could be a scenario where we would like to add styles to certain elements, but not all the elements.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.<br>
          Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li> To launch VS code on GitBash, type: code .</li>
        <li>Git commands are not the same as the bash commands such as: cd and mkdir, that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks.</li>
        <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
        <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
        <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
