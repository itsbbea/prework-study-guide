Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

A study guide for course pre-work.

As a bootcamp student, I wanted to create a website that's easy to navigate, where fellow bootcamp students can review what we've learnt so far during pre-work, all in one webpage.

I built this project in order to organize all my notes I've written for the topics I've covered during the pre-work course such as; HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. This way, I'll be able to look over different topics with ease.

By structuring our pre-work notes in seperate sections in a webiste, it will solve the hassle of having to read through the whole course entirely, and will organize our notes with a reliable, easy to read and streamlined wesbite that bootcamp students can use regularly.

Having a go-to webpage which stores the information I've learnt about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript helps me to view my notes efficiently and am able to build a simple website from scratch at a beginner level.
